# Loot of Olympus üèõÔ∏è‚ö°

**A Daily Challenge Game for Reddit, inspired by Greek Mythology and Collectibles.**

---

## Overview

**Loot of Olympus** is a Daily Challenge game built on Reddit‚Äôs Devvit Web platform. Players compete to answer a Greek mythology-themed question every 3 hours. The first 10 players to answer correctly claim a unique collectible tied to that question.

Think of it like **Pok√©mon meets Greek myths**, where your collection grows as you play, and each collectible tells a story.

## Backstory

I created this game in just **3 days** - coding whenever I could during lunch breaks and short moments in between classes. I pivoted my hackathon idea mid-way because I became really passionate about this concept. I‚Äôve always loved **Greek mythology** and the thrill of **collectibles**, so this project was something I could pour my heart into.

Despite the tight timeline, I focused on making a polished UI, fun interactions, and a system that could scale further if given more time.

## How to Play

1. Visit the subreddit r/lootofolympus (this might not be published yet).
2. Read the question, which appears every 3 hours.
3. Submit your answer in the input box.
4. If you are among the first **10 correct responders**, you claim the collectible.
5. Track your collectibles and see your progress in your **Profile** page.

**Hints & Features:**
- Collected items are highlighted, locked ones appear greyed out.
- The game encourages repeated engagement - check back every 3 hours for the next challenge!
- If you get a question wrong, you get the opportunity to retry in a future post.

## Current Scope & Future Plans

This is just the start. Given more time, I plan to expand Loot of Olympus in the following ways:

- **Multiple themed communities**: Each subreddit could have its own theme (e.g., Norse mythology, famous inventors, fantasy worlds).
- **User-generated questions**: Allow redditors to contribute their own questions for new collectibles.
- **Leaderboards & social interactions**: Track top collectors, encourage friendly competition, and integrate shareable results for Reddit posts.

These features could be added post-hackathon to make the game truly community-driven and scalable.

## Tech Stack

- **Devvit Web**: Reddit‚Äôs developer platform for interactive posts.
- **React + TypeScript**: For UI and logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, responsive styling and theming.
- **Backend**: Devvit API for post data, question scheduling, and claim tracking.
- **Redis**: Devvit's integrated Redis database to save user + question data.

## Notes

- This hackathon submission was built under tight time constraints (3 days).
- It represents the foundation of a larger, community-driven collectible game.
- The game is fully functional in its current state for **Daily Challenge gameplay**, with the potential to grow further.
